# 🎓 The Java Odyssey: University Chronicles

Welcome to **The Java Odyssey**, a curated collection of coding challenges, exercises, and projects developed during my university years. This repository represents a journey from the very basics of syntax to the complexities of Object-Oriented Programming and Advanced Data Structures.

## 📂 Repository Structure: The Curriculum

This archive is organized into "Blocks" ("Bloques"), each representing a specific chapter in learning Java. Here is the roadmap of concepts covered:

### 🐣 Phase 1: The Fundamentals
*Mastering the syntax and basic logic.*
- **Input & Output (`Bloque 1`)**: The "Hello World" phase. Learning to talk to the console and read user input.
- **Expressions & Operators (`Bloque 2`)**: Mathematical operations, logic gates, and variable manipulation.
- **Conditionals (`Bloque 3`)**: Decision making with `if`, `else`, and `switch`.
- **Loops (`Bloque 4`)**: Controlling flow with `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

### 🧩 Phase 2: Data Manipulation
*Handling collections and structured data.*
- **Arrays & Vectors (`Bloque 5`)**: Storing multiple values in single dimensions.
- **Matrices (`Bloque 6`)**: working with 2D arrays and grids.
- **Functions (`Bloque 9`)**: Modularizing code with methods and reusable logic.
- **Pointers(?) (`Bloque 10`)**: An exploration of references (and perhaps a peek into how Java handles memory differently than C++).

### 🏗️ Phase 3: Advanced Structures & OOP
*Architecting software and complex data organization.*
- **Linear Data Structures**:
  - **Stacks (`Bloque 11`)**: LIFO implementations.
  - **Queues (`Bloque 12`)**: FIFO implementations.
  - **Lists (`Bloque 13`)**: Linked lists and dynamic collections.
- **File Handling (`Bloque 14`)**: Reading from and writing to the file system (Persistence).
- **Object-Oriented Programming (`Bloque 15`)**: The core of modern Java.
  - *Includes*: Classes, Constructors, Encapsulation, Exceptions, Static members, and more.
- **Advanced Data Structures (`Bloque 18`)**:
  - Trees (B-Trees, traversals), Nodes, and complex hierarchy logic.

### 🛠️ Phase 4: Applied Practice
- **Practices (`Bloque 17`)**: Specialized exercises and mini-projects bringing multiple concepts together.

## 🚀 How to Run

These are standard Java console applications.

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. **Navigate** to a specific block folder.
3. **Compile** using `javac`:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```
4. **Run** the class file:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
   *(Note: Some IDE-specific folders like `.idea` are present if you prefer opening them in IntelliJ IDEA).*

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Language**: Java JDK
- **Concepts**: Algorithms, Data Structures, OOP, IO

## 📝 Note
This repository serves as a personal archive of my growth as a developer. While the code is functional, it reflects the learning curve of a student. Exploring it is like time-traveling through my coding education!
